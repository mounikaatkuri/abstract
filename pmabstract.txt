The current method of monitoring patients in hospitals keeps patients tied to their beds and can be uncomfortable for patients to wear. The number of nurses in the workforce is also expected to decline by 2020, causing strain in an environment where excess pressure can lead to unfortunate accidents happening to patients. The goal of this project was to produce a wireless patient monitoring system that could allow patients to be mobile in their environment. The developed system includes a pulse oximeter to measure blood oxygen concentration and the patient's pulse, as well as a temperature sensor to keep track of the patient's temperature. The proof of concept was successful, and allowed for multiple patients at the same time on the same network with the ability to add many more patients. This project was primarily undertaken by two undergraduate students during an NSF-sponsored 10-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer program.
